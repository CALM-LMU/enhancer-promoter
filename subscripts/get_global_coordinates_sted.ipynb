    "# Transformation of tables of pixel coordinates to world coordinates (for STED)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the correct alignment of datasets consisting of multiple images based on keypoints (e.g., fiducial beads), we need to transform keypoint coordinates in pixels to world coordinates (here: µm) that take stage position / scan field of the individual images into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "STED images have both a **stage/coarse offset** (stage position and objective focus position) as well as a **scan/fine offset** (position of recorded FOV relative to stage position and z position of Piezo stage). Z-stacks are acquired via the Piezo stage by default, going from low positions to high, so deeper parts of a sample (away from coverslip) are imaged first. This is in contrast to focusing by moving the objective: moving the objective up would go from the coverslip deeper into the sample. The solution used here is to **consider the image direction as the reference** - thus a higher objective focus would be a negative offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The world coordinate of a spot we calculate here will be:\n",
    "$(z_{pixel}, y_{pixel}, x_{pixel}) * pixel size + offset$\n",
    "with $offset = (- z_{stage}, y_{stage}, x_{stage}) + (z_{scan}, y_{scan}, x_{scan}) - \\frac{1}{2} FOVsize$ (both the stage and scan offsets are the sum of local and global offsets, and indicate the middle of the imaged FOV). Imspector uses coordinates in meters, for more microscopy-friendly units, we convert everything to µm in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the combined world z position will be negative most of the time, but it will be consistent across images and make subsequent alignment easier, as we do not have to consider extra z-flips of the image.\n",
